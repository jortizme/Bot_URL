        A call for faster Fedora updates in response to security vulnerabilities
was recently posted to the Fedora devel mailing list; it urgently advocated
changes to the process so that
updates, in general, and to the kernel and packages based on web
browsers, in particular, are handled more expeditiously.  While Fedora
developers are sympathetic to that, there is only 
so much the distribution can do as there are logistical and other hurdles
between Fedora and its users.  It turns out that, to a great extent, Fedora
can already move quickly when it needs to.

        Python's <a
href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.SimpleNamespace"><tt>SimpleNamespace</tt></a> class
provides an easy way for a programmer to create an object to store values
as attributes without creating their own (almost empty) class.  While it is
useful (and used) in its present form,   Raymond Hettinger thinks it could
be better.  He would like to see the hooks used by mappings
(e.g. dictionaries) added to the class, so that attributes can be added and
removed using either <tt>x.a</tt> or <tt>x['a']</tt>.  It would bring
benefits for JSON handling and more in the language.

        <p>
        For as long as operating systems have had kernels, there has been a need to
extract information from data structures stored within those kernels.  Over
the years, a wide range of approaches have been taken to make that
information available.  In current times, it has become natural to reach
for BPF as the tool of choice for a variety of problems, and getting
information from kernel data structures is no exception.  There are two
patches in circulation that take rather different approaches to using BPF
to dump information from kernel data structures to user space.

getting our basic infrastructure in place, but we can really start taking
advantage of it to rapidly improve the experience we are providing even

        The realtime scheduler classes are intended to allow a developer to state
which tasks have the highest priorities with the assurance that, at any
given time, the highest-priority task will have unimpeded access to the
CPU.  The kernel itself carries out a number of tasks that have tight time
constraints, so it is natural to want to assign realtime priorities to
kernel threads carrying out those tasks.  But, as Peter Zijlstra <a
href="/ml/linux-kernel/20200422112719.826676174@infradead.org/">argues</a>
in a new patch set, it makes little sense for the kernel to be assigning
such priorities; to put an end to that practice, he is proposing to take
away most of the kernel's ability to prioritize its own threads.

        A recent thread on the python-ideas mailing list explores adding a feature
to Python, which is the normal fare for that forum.
The problem being addressed is real, but 
may not be the highest-priority problem for the language on many people's
lists. Function calls that have multiple keyword arguments passed from a
variable of the same name (e.g. <tt>keyword=keyword</tt>) require
developers to repeat themselves and can be somewhat confusing, especially
to newcomers.
The discussion of ways to fix it highlighted some lesser-known corners of the
language, however, regardless of whether the idea will actually result in a
change to Python.

        Many applications benefit significantly from the use of huge
pages. However, huge-page allocations often incur a high latency or even
fail under fragmented memory conditions. Proactive compaction may provide an
effective solution to these problems by doing memory compaction in the
background. With guest author Nitin Gupta's proposed proactive compaction
implementation, typical huge-page allocation 
latencies are reduced by a factor of 70-80 while incurring minimal CPU
overhead.

        The <a href="/Articles/818687/">5.7-rc3</a> kernel prepatch is out for
testing.  "<span>Again, that all looks very normal and very much 'nothing
really odd 
stands out'.

In a world gone mad, the kernel looks almost boringly regular.

Which is just how I like it.</span>"

        Back in February, the kernel community <a
href="/Articles/813350/">discussed</a> the removal of a couple of functions
that could be used by loadable modules to gain access to symbols (functions
and data structures) that were not meant to be available to them.  That
change was <a href="https://git.kernel.org/linus/0bd476e6c671">merged</a>
during the 5.7 merge window.  This change will break a number of external
modules that depended on the removed functions; since many of those modules
are proprietary, this fact does not cause a great deal of anguish in the
kernel community.  But there are a few out-of-tree modules with
GPL-compatible licenses that are also affected by this change; one of those
is <a href="https://lttng.org/">LTTng</a>.  Fixing LTTng may not be
entirely straightforward.
